# Per-request knowledge retrieval — thin API over KnowledgeBase.
#
# Delegates to agent.knowledge (a MergedKnowledgeBase) which holds the
# virtual corpus index built at agent init from tree-files.txt or filesystem.
# Content is materialized on demand inside KnowledgeBase.query().
#
# This module exists as the stable external API for call_ai() in ai_transform.py.
# The retrieval logic lives in KnowledgeBase — not here.
#
# Called by: core/runtime/ai_transform.py (call_ai)
# See also:  shared/loaders/knowledge_base.py, core/runtime/load_knowledge.py

    Retrieve relevant knowledge fragments for a capability invocation.

    Delegates to agent.knowledge.query() if the agent has a KnowledgeBase.
    Falls back to empty list if the agent has no knowledge (slim=True,
    or knowledge loading failed at init).

    Args:
        agent_name    : Agent name — used for logging only
        capability_id : Canonical capability ID (e.g. "Trust.Assign")
        payload       : Capability input payload — keys/values become query terms
        agent         : Agent instance. Must have agent.knowledge (MergedKnowledgeBase).
                        When None, returns [].
        max_fragments : Maximum number of fragments to return

    Returns:
        List of fragment dicts:
        {
            "source":    str,   # relative file path
            "scope":     str,   # "agent" or "shared"
            "relevance": float, # 0.0–1.0
            "content":   str,   # truncated text
        }
        Sorted by relevance descending, agent scope first on ties.
        Returns [] on any failure — never raises.
