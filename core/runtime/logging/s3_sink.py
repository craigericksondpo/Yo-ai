# core/runtime/logging/s3_sink.py
#
# Fixes applied:
#   - One PUT per log record — extremely expensive at scale. Fixed with
#     an in-memory buffer. Records accumulate and are written as a single
#     PUT when the buffer reaches LOG_S3_FLUSH_RECORDS records, or when
#     flush() is called explicitly (e.g. at handler completion).
#   - boto3 imported at module level — lazy import inside __init__ instead.
#   - No error handling — all boto3 calls now wrapped in try/except.
#     Logging must never crash an agent.
#   - flush() and close() implemented per LogSink contract.
#
# Configuration (.venv / environment):
#   LOG_S3_FLUSH_RECORDS — flush after N records (default: 50)
#
# S3 key format: <prefix>/<date>/<uuid>.jsonl
#
# Important: records in the buffer are lost if the execution environment
# terminates before flush() is called. For critical audit records, use
# DynamoDB sink (LOG_SINK=dynamodb) alongside S3.
