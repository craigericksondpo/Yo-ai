# core/runtime/logging/json_file_sink.py
#
# Fixes applied:
#   - File opened and closed on every write() — fixed by opening once
#     at construction in append mode and holding the handle open.
#     flush() called after every write() to ensure records survive
#     process exit without requiring an explicit close().
#   - No error handling — all file I/O now wrapped in try/except.
#     Logging must never crash an agent.
#   - flush() and close() implemented per LogSink contract.
