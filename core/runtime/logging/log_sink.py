    Abstract base class for all Yo-ai log sinks.

    Contract (all implementations must honor):
      - write() must never raise — logging must never crash an agent.
        Catch all exceptions internally; log to stderr as last resort.
      - flush() is a no-op for sinks that do not buffer. Sinks that
        buffer (e.g. S3Sink) must flush remaining records.
      - close() releases held resources (file handles, connections).
        Must be safe to call even if the sink was never fully opened,
        and safe to call multiple times.
