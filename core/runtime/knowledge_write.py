# core/runtime/knowledge_write.py
#
# Write new knowledge to agent-specific or shared knowledge repositories.
#
# Changes from original:
#   - datetime.utcnow() → datetime.now(timezone.utc)  (deprecated Python 3.12+)
#   - Weak trust gate (hasattr duck-type) replaced with isinstance check
#     against RegisteredAgent — Gap Registry MEDIUM flaw
#   - Reload notification: agents initialized before a write won't see new
#     files until restarted (Gap Registry ⚠️ open). A warning is now logged
#     with guidance. Runtime reload is deferred — see Gap Registry item.
#   - SHARED_ROOT and AGENTS_ROOT respect env overrides (consistent with
#     knowledge_query.py and load_knowledge.py)
#
# Trust gate:
#   add_shared_knowledge() — requires a RegisteredAgent instance
#   add_agent_knowledge()  — requires the agent's own instance
#   Both gates verified via isinstance, not duck-typing
#
# See: knowledge_query.py, load_knowledge.py
