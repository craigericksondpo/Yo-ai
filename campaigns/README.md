# yo-ai-assurance-platform \ campaigns

The "campaigns" folder contains projects or experiments involving multiple agents.

Each campaign has its own folder, with a README.md.

For example, red-yellow-green is a campaign to determine the readiness of other organizations' or consumers' A2A agents to register on the Yo-ai Platform. It serves as an introductary awareness campaign promoting familiarity with the platform, and generates a report on A2A readiness: how many are "green" (ready), "yellow" (hesitant), or "red" (resistant).

RegisteredAgent-Onboarding is a campaign to introduce Registered Agents to the Yo-ai Platform, and generates a report on the "Registered Agent Journey".

Am-I-A-Threat is a campaign to determine the trust level of AI Agent "Operators", as perceived by a counterparty (an organization or individual person) the Operator interacts with.
