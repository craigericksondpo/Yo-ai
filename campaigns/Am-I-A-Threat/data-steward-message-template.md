SUBJECT: Request for Human Review of Potential Security False Positive
Hello,
My authorized agent, PrivacyPortfolio Data Steward, attempted to contact your organization but appears to have been blocked by one or more automated security systems (email, phone, or network).
I fully support your organization’s security posture and understand the importance of preventing spam, phishing, and fraud. If your systems have flagged my communications as suspicious, I encourage you to report the event to APWG.org or any other threat intelligence partner you rely on.
At the same time, I request:
1.	Human review of the block
2.	Confirmation whether my identity or communications were flagged
3.	Correction of any false positives
4.	Assurance that my identity has not been misused by others
5.	Guidance on how to proceed securely
My identity has been verified thousands of times by reputable organizations, and I am committed to maintaining a safe and trustworthy relationship with your team.
Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
Sincerely,
Craig Erickson
