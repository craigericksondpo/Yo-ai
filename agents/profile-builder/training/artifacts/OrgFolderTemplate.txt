    +---ADMT
        This is where Risk Assessments on Automated Decision-Making Technologies are stored.
        They are used by the Risk-Assessor and Compliance-Validator for conducting ADMT assessments,
        the Decision-Master for analyzing decision-set-outcomes,
        and receives input from Complaint-Manager, Profile-Builder, Vendor-Manager, and Data-Steward
        for directing and using the assessments. ADMT assessments can also be treated as a complaint artifact.
        The Rewards-Seeker can also leverage ADMT assessments to bring or join in lawsuits or bug bounties.
