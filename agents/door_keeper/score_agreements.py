# core/runtime/score_agreements.py
#
# Agreement scoring for trust tier evaluation.
#
# "0 agreements = 0 promises."
# All Yo-ai agents are strongly encouraged to negotiate signed agreements
# with RegisteredAgents and Subscribers. This module counts and scores
# agreements held by any party — Door-Keeper itself, a RegisteredAgent
# presenting for authentication, or a Subscriber registering on the platform.
#
# Agreement artifacts live in:
#   agents/<agent_name>/training/artifacts/agreements/   (agent's own agreements)
#   agents/<agent_name>/training/artifacts/agreements/<subject_id>/  (per-subject)
#
# Agreement files are JSON artifacts matching the agreement-template shape:
#   {
#     "event":          "data_processing_agreement",
#     "timestamp":      "2025-12-18T08:25:00Z",
#     "subscriberId":   "sub-456",
#     "approvedSkills": ["Log-Event"],
#     "conditions":     { "scope": "...", "logging": "...", "expiry": "..." },
#     "issuedBy":       "Data-Steward Agent",
#     "proxy":          "Vendor-Manager Agent"
#   }
#
# Scoring model:
#   0 agreements        → score 0.0  — no promises, no trust contribution
#   1 agreement         → score 0.3  — minimal commitment
#   2 agreements        → score 0.5  — baseline
#   3–4 agreements      → score 0.7  — established
#   5+ agreements       → score 0.9  — well-governed
#
#   Deductions:
#     expired agreement         → -0.1 per expired (broken promise)
#     missing required fields   → -0.05 per malformed artifact
#
#   Score is clamped to [0.0, 1.0]
#
# Called by: trust_assign.py
