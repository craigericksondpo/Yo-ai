    Capability: Agent.Authenticate
    Authenticates a registered agent and monitors activity.

    Two authentication paths (per Door-Keeper Training Manual):
      1. RegisteredAgentCard authToken found
         → trusted directly, bypasses Cognito
      2. No registered card found
         → falls back to Cognito validation (AWS Cognito, backend: AgentAuthenticator)

    Every decision is logged and published to the agent-auth Kafka topic.

    WARNING (stub): authenticated is hardcoded True.
    Real implementation must check Cognito before returning.

    Args:
        payload        (dict): Pre-extracted capability input.
        agent_ctx      (AgentContext): Governance context.
        capability_ctx (CapabilityContext): Execution context — dry_run, trace.
