# shared/tools/adapters/vault_adapter_tool.py
#
# Fixes applied:
#   - raise ValueError("Unknown VaultAdapter action") propagated raw →
#     unknown actions now return a structured error dict.
#   - No error handling on vault.fetch_fields() / vault.list_inventory()
#     → all vault calls wrapped in try/except, returns structured error dict
#     that ToolRegistry wraps in ToolResult.
#
# Architecture note:
#   VaultAdapterTool is wired manually — it is NOT loaded from x-artifacts
#   by bootstrap_tools.py. The vault adapter requires an injected dependency
#   (the vault client) that cannot be resolved from card config alone.
#
#   Manual wiring pattern (in the agent or its handler):
#       from shared.tools.adapters.vault_adapter_tool import VaultAdapterTool
#       vault_tool = VaultAdapterTool(vault_adapter=my_vault_client)
#       registry.register("VaultAdapter", vault_tool)
#
#   The calling run() module must follow the LOGGING.md tool boundary pattern:
#       - Log BEFORE the vault call (with correlationId + taskId)
#       - Log AFTER the vault call (with correlationId + taskId + outcome)
#       - Never log the returned data — log shape/field count only

    Tool adapter wrapping a personal data vault.

    Dispatches to the underlying vault_adapter based on the 'action'

    Supported actions:
        fetch_fields     — retrieve a subset of personal data fields
        list_inventory   — list available data categories

    execute() returns a dict. On any failure, returns a structured
    error dict — ToolRegistry wraps this in a ToolResult.
