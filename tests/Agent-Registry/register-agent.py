# This script tests the registration of agents within the Yo-ai platform's Agent Registry.
# It ensures that agents can be registered correctly and that their information is stored as expected.
# The test covers various scenarios including successful registration, duplicate registrations, guest agent provisioning, and denied registrations.
# Another test, negotiate-agreement.py, focuses on the negotiation of access and processing agreements between agents and the Yo-ai platform.
