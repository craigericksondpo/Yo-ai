# This script is the high-level wrapper for negotiating access and processing agreements between agents and the Yo-ai platform.
# It ensures that agents can successfully negotiate terms for accessing platform resources and processing capabilities.
# The negotiation process includes validating agent credentials, defining access scopes, and establishing processing limits.
# The script also handles various negotiation scenarios, including successful agreements, denied requests, and conditional access based on agent roles.
