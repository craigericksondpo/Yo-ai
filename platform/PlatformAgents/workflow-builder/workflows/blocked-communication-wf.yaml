Craig, let’s build this as if your Data Steward were a regulator grade incident response system for blocked communications, fully aligned with your behavioral risk model, your multi agent ecosystem, and your Twilio enabled A2A architecture.
Below is a complete, end to end package:
•	A Blocked Communications Detection Workflow
•	A DAG for your compiler
•	A template message your Data Steward sends to stakeholders
•	A risk scoring extension for block events
•	A regulator ready evidence manifest
•	A full simulation of the campaign against a real vendor (Accenture)
Everything is written so you can drop it directly into your Data Steward, Risk Assessor, Complaint Manager, and Vendor Manager agents.

✔ 1. Blocked Communications Detection Workflow
This is the full lifecycle your Data Steward should execute whenever an organization blocks email, phone, or network traffic.
PHASE 1 — Detection
Your Data Steward continuously monitors:
Email
•	SMTP 550/554 rejections
•	Greylisting
•	Silent drops
•	DMARC/DKIM/SPF failures
•	Proofpoint/Mimecast/Barracuda/EOP blocks
•	“Suspicious content” flags
•	No response within expected SLA
Phone
•	Immediate disconnect
•	“This number is not accepting calls”
•	Carrier level blocking
•	Reputation score too low
•	IVR loops with no human escalation
Network / Portal
•	403 Forbidden
•	429 Too Many Requests
•	451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons
•	CAPTCHA loops
•	WAF blocks
•	Bot detection
•	Rate limiting
•	Session invalidation
Social / API
•	Shadowbans
•	API key throttling
•	“Suspicious activity” flags
Each detection triggers a BlockedCommunicationEvent.

PHASE 2 — Classification
Your Data Steward classifies the block:
A. Automated Security Block
•	Spam/phishing detection
•	Fraud scoring
•	Bot detection
•	IP/phone reputation
•	APWG feed match
•	Vendor’s internal threat intel
B. Policy Block
•	“We do not respond to agents”
•	“We do not respond to automated requests”
•	“We do not respond to repeated requests”
C. Retaliatory Block
•	After a complaint
•	After escalation
•	After regulatory involvement
D. Operational Block
•	Misconfiguration
•	Outage
•	Rate limit
•	Human error
________________________________________
PHASE 3 — Attribution
Your Data Steward attempts to determine:
•	Which system blocked you
•	Which vendor provided the threat intel
•	Whether APWG was involved
•	Whether a third party fraud vendor was involved
•	Whether the block is reversible
•	Whether the block is retaliatory
•	Whether the block is automated
•	Whether the block is human initiated
This uses:
•	DarkWeb Checker
•	DataBroker Monitor
•	SocialMedia Checker
•	Vendor Manager
•	Risk Assessor
________________________________________
PHASE 4 — Response
Your Data Steward sends a non accusatory, security aligned message (template below).
________________________________________
PHASE 5 — Evidence Collection
Your Data Steward generates:
•	Timeline
•	SMTP logs
•	Phone logs
•	Network logs
•	Risk scores
•	Vendor behavior patterns
•	Identity verification history
•	Evidence of legitimate purpose
•	Evidence of retaliation (if applicable)
________________________________________
PHASE 6 — Escalation
If the organization refuses to acknowledge the block:
•	Complaint Manager files a complaint
•	Evidence manifest is attached
•	Risk Assessor updates risk score
•	Vendor Manager updates vendor profile
•	Data Steward continues periodic testing
