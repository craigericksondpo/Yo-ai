🔐 Suggested Workflow
1.	Agent submits registration payload to your registry endpoint.
2.	Registry validates identity, public key, and declared capabilities.
3.	Authentication method is negotiated (e.g., OAuth2 token exchange).
4.	Access rights are provisioned based on scopes and compliance mappings.
5.	Agent is issued a credential or token for future A2A interactions.
6.	Audit log entry is created with timestamp, agent ID, and evidence link.
