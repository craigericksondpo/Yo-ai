The following Yo-ai Platform Rules:
•	Agents / bots / service accounts cannot exist without a human or organization legally responsible for them.
•	That human must sign agreements, maintain credentials, and be reachable.
•	The human is accountable for the agent’s behavior.
•	The platform logs all agent activity and exposes it to the responsible human.

are also best practices by:
•	AWS IAM + Service Accounts
•	Google Cloud Service Agents
•	OpenAI’s Enterprise API governance
•	Anthropic’s Responsible AI Contact model
•	GitHub Apps + Owner Accounts
•	OAuth2 Client Credentials with Admin Consent
•	Enterprise SaaS “Accountable Owner” requirements

This solves the biggest risk in agent ecosystems:
autonomous agents with no accountable owner.

“If you run agents on our platform, you must subscribe to the audit stream that shows what your agents are doing.”
