The "articles" folder is a general knowledge repository of news stories selected by platform users which represents their personal interests. 

Web pages, saved from browsers like Firefox and Edge, include resource files which can be analyzed and mined for discovery of tracking tools and stakeholders.

News feeds can be sourced from this repository. A scheduled, daily task generates a read-only tree-files.txt and dir.txt in this "articles" folder. These files should be copied to another location when they are modified.
